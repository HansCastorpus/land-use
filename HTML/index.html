        <h1>Animal Land Use in Western United States</h1>
        <p class="title__text">
          Welcome to this interactive map based in the western continental
          United States, where you can choose between different map layers to
          compare land allotments for wild horses, goat and sheep grazing, and
          overlay them with the national forest areas. This map provides a
          straightforward visual representation of how these land uses interact
          or coexist. Notice that these areas do not overlap with human cities,
          highlighting the careful balance between natural habitats and human
          settlements. You can explore the dynamic relationship between these
          allotments and how they are shaped by the landscape.
